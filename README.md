## Workout app


The theme of our project is workout app. Our aim is to create the application that can help people who engage in a gym to control their trainings at all, its regularity, progress etc.
<br>Most of people who practice workout try to trace it making notes in a notepad or phone, but it isn't often so easy. So, we want to automatize this process. Moreover, thanks to this app people have the opportunity to see the analysis of their work graphically.
<br>Our project will be presented as a web application with the prospect of a mobile app. In it a user can create a training course and enter his results of the each training due to the course. If he doesn't want to create it, he can just enter current results of trainings. After every time he goes to the gym (or throughout the training) he chooses the specific exercises he carries out, the weight with which he does it, count of reps, and other optional items: the type of the training, the duration of each exercise and the whole training etc. It's also possible to leave a comment about a training. Types of exercises are available from the base of exercises, so it isn't necessary for user to type it, he can just choose it from the list. After entering this information the user can see the statistics of the whole period of his trainings, including a table or graphics interpretation. 
<br>This application will be useful both for the beginners and professional athletes.
